&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I don‚Äôt get is credit cards. Like why would I borrow money from a bank if I have money myself? Even if I don‚Äôt have money I could just get a regular credit. Maybe because banks are giving neat premiums to credit card people? That‚Äôs pretty evil. They‚Äôre locking you into spending money you don‚Äôt have.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, (&lt;em&gt;I‚Äôm kind of conflicted on this one&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) how is interest on credit allowed? It‚Äôs like letting a bank owe you money you didn‚Äôt take from them. Someone said to me that interest on credit exists because&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who pays the guy for his time ?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for interest would be a higher incentive to pay back I guess.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;visa-mastercard-and-why-cryptocurrencies-are-superior&quot;&gt;VISA, Mastercard, ‚Ä¶ and why cryptocurrencies are superior&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#visa-mastercard-and-why-cryptocurrencies-are-superior&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: visa-mastercard-and-why-cryptocurrencies-are-superior&quot;&gt;¬ß&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would you trust these companies with processing your payments? What if their services are offline? They don‚Äôt open source their server software because anyone could just copy them I guess. But how do you know what is running on the servers? It is like a black box. I‚Äôd much rather like to pay with a hardware or software crypto wallet. If I choose the right &lt;strong&gt;stable&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; cryptocurrency I can be anonymous and sure that no single entity has control over all of the world‚Äôs finance because cryptocurrencies are mostly decentralized, meaning the computers processing payments aren‚Äôt in a single location owned by a single entity. With crypto I also know that for cryptocurrencies to be decentralized their code has to be free so anyone can run a server.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately cryptocurrencies are kind of a bandaid at the moment because you need websites like BlockFi or Coinbase to exchange USD for example into a cryptocurrency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
